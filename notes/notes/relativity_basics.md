# Relativity — Basics

Relativity includes **Special Relativity (SR)** and **General Relativity (GR)**.

## 1. Special Relativity

**Postulates:**
1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames.
2. The speed of light in vacuum is constant for all observers.

**Key Relations:**

- **Time dilation:**
  
  $$
  t' = \gamma t, \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
  $$

- **Length contraction:**
  
  $$
  L' = \frac{L}{\gamma}
  $$

- **Energy–momentum relation:**
  
  $$
  E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2
  $$

## 2. General Relativity

Gravity is described as the curvature of spacetime.  
The **Einstein Field Equations** are:

$$
G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} \, T_{\mu\nu}
$$

**Schwarzschild Metric** (spherically symmetric, vacuum solution):

$$
ds^2 = -\left( 1 - \frac{2GM}{r c^2} \right) c^2 dt^2
       + \left( 1 - \frac{2GM}{r c^2} \right)^{-1} dr^2
       + r^2 d\Omega^2
$$

where:

$$
d\Omega^2 = d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2
$$
