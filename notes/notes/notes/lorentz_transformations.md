# Lorentz Transformations (Special Relativity)

## Standard Lorentz Transformation
Between two inertial frames $S$ and $S'$ moving at velocity $v$ along the $x$ axis:

$$
t' = \gamma \left( t - \frac{vx}{c^2} \right), \quad
x' = \gamma (x - vt), \quad
y' = y, \quad
z' = z
$$

where
$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
$$

## Consequences
- **Time dilation**: Moving clocks run slower.
- **Length contraction**: Moving rods are shorter along the direction of motion.
- **Relativity of simultaneity**: Events that are simultaneous in one frame may not be in another.
